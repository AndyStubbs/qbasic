# QBasic Games and Demos Collection

This is an archive of programs, games, and graphical experiments I created in my childhood in the 90's. This repository showcases the creativity and exploration of early programming through the QBasic language.

## ðŸ“‚ Highlights

The programs in this collection range from simple graphical experiments to fully playable games. Below are some of the highlights from the **Best** folder, which contains the most polished and memorable creations:

### **Completed Games**
- **BASEBALL.BAS**  
	A fun and simple baseball simulation. Swing for the fences and enjoy the retro graphics.
- **FIGHT.BAS**  
	A side view walking and shooting game with some action. Also has a airplane mini-game.
- **LAND.BAS**  
	A turn-based strategy game of conquest where you control a kingdom and try to conquer all the other kingdoms.
- **STARS.BAS**  
	A 2d star wars game where you pilot an x-wing and take on tie-fighters, imperial walkers and a star destroyer as the final boss.
- **space** (**QB45 Required**)
	A generic 2d action space game.
- **sinister**
	A text based adventure game placing you on a small island and you have to find a way off the island by slaying a monster and earning enough money to purchase a boat to leave.

### **Applications**
- **Udraw** (**QB45 Required**)
	A drawing program that let's you draw images of various sizes at the same time. Great for working on small sprites for QBasic games. Can save the drawings in a format compatible with QB 64.

### **Demos**
- **STARFLD.BAS**  
	A multistep starfield simulator that turns into all sorts of different effects at the press of a key.
- **GAME**  
	A framework for a top down 2d RPG style game, but incomplete and no real action.

## ðŸš€ Running the Programs

To run these I find it best to use DOSBox. You can also try QB64, but most of the games and demos will run too fast in QB64 on a modern PC.
